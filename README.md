# How to set up Twitch Emotes on YouTube on Google Chrome

This repo will show you how install Twitch Emotes on Youtube within a few steps using an extension called Global Twitch Emotes.

### Insturctions
First, if you don't use Google Chrome you will need it. This only works on Google Chrome.

Install the extension [Global Twitch Emotes](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/global-twitch-emotes/pgniedifoejifjkndekolimjeclnokkb?hl=en) from the Chrome Web Store.

Download my Global Twitch Emote settings file within the repo above called GTESettings.txt

Once the extension is installed, click the icon for it in the top right corner, click the gear icon.
Then click import settings and click the text file that you downloaded above called GTESettings.txt

That's all! You can choose to hide the extension if you want or turn it off when not using it.
